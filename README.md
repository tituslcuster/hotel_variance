# hotel_variance
This repository holds the HTML for my knitted R Markdown report from the small project that I worked on entitled 'Variance in Hotel Arrival Times.' Working on this project adjecently to my Google certification was a great way to codify the concepts I was learning. 

While the dates in the graphs might seem strange in their current state, I hope to commit substantial changes to this in the future!
